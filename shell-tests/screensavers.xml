Anemotaxis demonstrates a search algorithm designed for locating a

the odor and determine local instantaneous wind direction.  The goal is
to find the source in the shortest mean time.

the period.

In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program
and runs it.  In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or
the contents of a file or URL.  In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random
images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][
display hardware.  (Six available colors in hi-res mode!)

On X11 systems, This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator.

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations:
the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted
clockwise.  Then the same thing is done again with progressively
smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are
rotated in parallel.  As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve
into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated.

otherwise.

This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs.  The blobs
change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent,
so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one
passes over another, their colors merge.  I got the idea for this from
a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real
life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them.

This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are
the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed
of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of
six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of
eight cubes, each touching six others.  To make it easier to
visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of
each face.  Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.

Coloration is done based on elevation.

The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some
arbitrary size.  Circles are drawn with small moving points along the
perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs.  Glowing
orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the
intersection point.

<_description>
This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects.

You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces.  The vertices on these
faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the
surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the
neighbors.  They also have inertia.  The resulting effect can range
from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm.
Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles
in a kind of disturbing manner.

This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle,

when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab
the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...)  When
it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess
what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved.

This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to

can often repair the damage.  That's what this screen saver does.

copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark
Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a
pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in
nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper.  Penrose said he
doesn't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of
Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms
on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last
stand must be taken."
